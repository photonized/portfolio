# Vlad's Portfolio Website


Hey, welcome to my personal website, hosted at [https://vladjdk.com](vladjdk.com)


I've always been a backend type of guy. Algorithms, data structures, complex pipelines. That's my forte.


I've always appreciated people's ability to design. I figured that it wouldn't hurt to learn the skill.


This is my first attempt at a front-end website. I chose to use React, as it seems like a popular choice within the community.


This website will likely show my progression as I develop an eye for design in the world of web-based art/development.


If you have any tips or suggestions, don't be afraid to send me an email at vladjdk@gmail.com.
